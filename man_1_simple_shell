.SH NAME
simple_shell - a simpler version of a Linux shell

.SH AUTHORS
This man page was created by Achraf Jeddi and Johan Villard.

.SH SYNOPSIS
./simple_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell is an executable that forks the current Linux shell process,
hence inheriting and using the same environment variables, and commands.
The commands uses the commands directly from the /usr/bin/ directory.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples demonstrate the usage of simple_shell:

root@ubuntu:~/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ ./simple_shell
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ echo "echo works on the simple shell"
echo works on the simple shell
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ 

Example 1: The simple shell uses the echo built-in located in the /usr/bin/ directory
to mimic echo just like in the parent shell, which takes the input
and turns it into an output. It then loops to wait for another command.

root@ubuntu:~/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ ./simple_shell
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ ls /
1    boot  etc   lib    lib64   media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
bin  dev   home  lib32  libx32  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ 

Example 2: The simple shell uses the ls built-in located in the /usr/bin/ directory
to mimic ls just like in the parent shell, which outputs the list of files
and directories contained in the actual root directory with their details,
including hidden files and directories.
It then loops to wait for another command.

root@ubuntu:~/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ ./simple_shell
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ which cat
/usr/bin/cat
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ 

Example 3: The simple shell uses the cat built-in located in the /usr/bin/ directory
to mimic the which command, locating the binary corresponding
to the command name passed in arguments.
It then loops to wait for another command.

root@ubuntu:~/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ ./simple_shell
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ clear
/root/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ 

Example 4: The simple shell uses the clear built-in located in the /usr/bin/ directory
to mimic the clear command, which recolors the terminal entirely in black
and puts the prompt line back to the top. However, due to the nature of
the window coloring, the command uses the TERM environment variable.
It then loops to wait for another command.
